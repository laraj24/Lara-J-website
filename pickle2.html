<p>Vlasic Pickles are a classic pickle. They are a go to brand for a lot of people. They have an iconic mascot, stork, which gives a personal touch to the packaging. They are a very sour and vinegar heavy pickle and have a slightly unappatizing neon green color, making them difficult to enjoy by themself. However, they give a greak kick to any sandwich or meals that needs some flavor!  </p>
