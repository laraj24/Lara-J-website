<p>Grillo's Pickles are known for their locally sourced ingredients. 
They are made in small batches and each jar is very yummy! 
They have a perfect balance of tangyness, crunch, and are not overpowering.
They are my favorite pickles. However, they have severe issues with the packaging, you can't open the jars without leakage. 
This takes down the rating of these pickles pretty significantly.</p>
